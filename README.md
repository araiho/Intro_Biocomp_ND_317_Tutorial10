# In Question 2 if you look at the Beta_Gamma_Effects.pdf figure you can see the effects of different beta and gamma values on the different disease variables we explored. Beta is the transmission rate of the disease and gamma is the recovery rate. For the upper left figure, max incidence is highest when the recovery rate (gamma) is lowest and the transmission rate (beta) is highest. When transmission rate increases, the max incidence increases. When the recovery rate increase, the max incidence decreases. For the upper right figure, max prevalence overall follows the same pattern as incidence. With increasing transmission, there is increased prevalence and vice versa for recovery. The lower left figure shows that the percent affected by the end time step of the disease does not change with different rates of recovery and transmission. The final panel in the lower right corner shows the basic reproduction number (BRN) of the disease. Again, with increasing transmission there is increased BRN, and with increased recovery there is decreased BRN.
