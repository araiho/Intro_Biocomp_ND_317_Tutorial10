# The basics of an infectious disease model are simple. The higher the infection rate, the quicker people become infected. Raising the infection parameter (beta), exponentially increases the number of infected. However, the rate of resistance development (gamma), can counteract the number of infected, acting in a similar fashion where raising the number exponentially decreases the number of infected and raises the number of resistant patients. What's interesting is the relationship between these two. Because the change in resistant changes relative to the number of people infected, the percent affected has a direct relationship to how much of the population is resistant, and thus the Beta factor seems more important at first. However, as we can see in the basic reproduction number, both beta and gamma are both important, especially initially, where there are essentially no resistant population in the area.
