We have learned that increasing beta while holding gamma constant 
increases the basic reproduction number, increases the percent affected, 
inreases the maximum daily prevalance, and generally increases the 
maximum daily incidence.  Likewise, increasing gamma while holding beta 
constant decreases the basic reproduction number, decreases the percent 
effected, decreases the maximum daily prevalance, and decreases the 
maximum daily incidence.  If we return to how our model was constructed, 
these results make sense.  Moreover, these parameters are small and thus 
quite sensitive to a small absolute change in value.
